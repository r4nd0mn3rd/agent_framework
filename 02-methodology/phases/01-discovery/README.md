## Tips for Success

### For Specification Agents

✅ **Do**:
- **Be thorough** - Cover all aspects of the problem
- **Use reliable sources** - Quality in, quality out
- **Document everything** - If it's not written down, it doesn't exist
- **Ask for clarification** - Don't guess at requirements
- **Think critically** - Don't just accept the first solution
- **Present options** - Give the human choices with trade-offs

❌ **Don't**:
- **Skip research areas** - Comprehensive research prevents surprises
- **Use unreliable sources** - Bad information leads to bad decisions
- **Ignore constraints** - Constraints shape the solution
- **Ignore risks** - Unmitigated risks can derail the project
- **Submit with open questions** - Gate 1 will be rejected

### For Human Developers

✅ **Do**:
- **Provide clear direction** - Guide the agent's research
- **Answer questions promptly** - Delays here delay the whole project
- **Make decisions** - Don't defer important decisions
- **Review thoroughly** - Catch issues early
- **Consider long-term implications** - Think beyond this feature

❌ **Don't**:
- **Be vague about requirements** - Clarity prevents rework
- **Defer all decisions** - Some decisions are needed to proceed
- **Ignore research findings** - The agent's work is valuable
- **Rush the review** - Thorough review prevents later issues

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Incomplete research** | Missing technology options | Be thorough in research |
| **Superficial research** | Only surface-level information | Dig deeper into each area |
| **Ignoring constraints** | Constraints not identified | Systematically check all categories |
| **Underestimating risks** | Risks not properly assessed | Use likelihood/impact matrix |
| **Open questions at submission** | Questions remain | Answer all questions before submission |
| **Bias in technology selection** | Only researching preferred option | Research all viable options |

---

## Next Phase

**After Gate 1 passes** → Proceed to **Phase 2: Specification**

- **Objective**: Define what the feature should do
- **Primary Agent**: Specification Agent
- **Duration**: 3-7 days

6. **Assess Risks**:
   - R-001: SampleProvider rate limits (Low likelihood, Medium impact) - Mitigation: Implement caching
   - R-002: User denies location permission (Medium likelihood, High impact) - Mitigation: Support manual location entry
   - R-003: Development API returns inaccurate data (Low likelihood, Medium impact) - Mitigation: Use multiple sources

7. **Identify Open Questions**:
   - Q-001: Should we use Metric or Standard as default?
     - Options: Metric (metric), Standard (imperial)
     - Recommendation: Metric (more common globally)
     - Decision: Human selects Metric
   - Q-002: What should we show when offline?
     - Options: Last cached data, error message, nothing
     - Recommendation: Last cached data with stale indicator
     - Decision: Human selects last cached data with stale indicator

8. **Resolve All Questions**: Works with human to answer all questions

9. **Formulate Recommendations**:
