# Phase 2: Specification

> **Phase ID**: 2
> **Name**: Specification
> **Duration**: 3-7 days
> **Gate**: Gate 2 - Specification Approved
> **Primary Agent**: Specification Agent
> **Human Involvement**: High (reviews, decisions)

---

## Purpose

**Define WHAT the feature should do, not HOW to build it.**

This phase creates a complete, unambiguous specification that:
- Answers all questions about feature behavior
- Provides clear acceptance criteria
- Enables implementation without further clarification
- Serves as the contract between stakeholders and implementers

**Key Question**: "What exactly are we building, and how will we know it's correct?"

**Critical Rule**: **NO implementation can start until Gate 2 is passed** (Constitution Principle V).

---

## Objectives

By the end of Phase 2, you should have:

1. ✅ **Complete feature specification** (`spec.md`)
2. ✅ **User stories with acceptance scenarios** (Given-When-Then format)
3. ✅ **Functional requirements** (FR-*) - Clear, testable statements
4. ✅ **Non-functional requirements** (NFR-*) - Performance, security, etc.
5. ✅ **Edge cases identified and addressed**
6. ✅ **Success criteria** (SC-*) - Measurable outcomes
7. ✅ **Constraints, assumptions, dependencies** documented
8. ✅ **Test strategy** defined
9. ✅ **Documentation requirements** listed
10. ✅ **Rollout plan** defined
11. ✅ **Open Questions section is EMPTY**
12. ✅ **Passed Gate 2** (Specification Approved)

## Input

- **Approved Research** from Phase 1
- **Approved Idea** from Phase 0
- **Constitution principles** (`00-constitution/constitution.md`)
- **Project goals and vision**

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Vague requirements** | "System should be fast" | Make requirements specific and measurable |
| **Missing user stories** | No user perspective | Add user stories with acceptance scenarios |
| **Non-testable requirements** | "User should have good experience" | Make requirements testable |
| **Missing edge cases** | No error handling | Think through all possible scenarios |
| **Open questions at submission** | Questions remain | Answer all questions before submission |
| **Inconsistent requirements** | FR-001 says X, FR-002 says not X | Resolve conflicts |
| **Implementation details** | Requirements specify how to implement | Focus on WHAT, not HOW |
| **Incomplete sections** | Sections left empty | Fill all required sections |

12. **Document Dependencies**:
    - ED-001: SampleProvider API (Required, No fallback)
    - ID-001: LocationService module (Required, Already exists)

13. **Define Success Criteria**:
