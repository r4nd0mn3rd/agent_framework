## Overview

This document defines the **architecture standards** for all features developed using the Solo Agent Development Framework. These standards ensure that all architectural decisions are **consistent, maintainable, scalable, and aligned with the Constitution Principles**.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Constitution Alignment**: All architectures must comply with Constitution Principles
2. **Simplicity**: Keep architectures as simple as possible
3. **Testability**: All architectures must be testable
4. **Maintainability**: All architectures must be easy to maintain
5. **Scalability**: All architectures must be scalable
6. **Consistency**: All architectures must be consistent with framework patterns

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer

**Purpose**: User interface and user experience

- ViewModels
- UI Components
- Navigation
- Localization

**Standards**:
- [ ] Follow platform-specific UI guidelines
- [ ] Use MVVM or MVC pattern
- [ ] Keep business logic out of views
- [ ] Make all UI accessible
- [ ] Support all required languages
- [ ] Follow UI design system

---

### 2. Business Logic Layer

**Purpose**: Core application logic and business rules

**Components**:
- Use Cases
- Services
- Managers
- Validators
- Business Rules
- State Management

**Responsibilities**:
- Implement business rules
- Validate data
- Manage application state
- Coordinate between layers

**Standards**:
- [ ] Keep business logic separate from UI and data
- [ ] Make business logic testable
- [ ] Use dependency injection
- [ ] Follow SOLID principles
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Validate all inputs

---

### 3. Data Layer

**Purpose**: Data storage, retrieval, and management

**Components**:
- Repositories
- Data Sources (Local and Remote)
- Models (Data Transfer Objects)
- Database
- Caching
- APIs

**Responsibilities**:
- Store and retrieve data
- Manage database operations

- [ ] Follow Constitution Principles for data

---

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Layered Architecture

**Description**: Separate application into distinct layers

**Layers**:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│     Presentation Layer   │
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Business Logic Layer   │
├─────────────────────────┤
│       Data Layer         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Rules**:
- [ ] Each layer can only depend on the layer below it
- [ ] Presentation Layer can depend on Business Logic Layer
- [ ] Business Logic Layer can depend on Data Layer
- [ ] Data Layer cannot depend on any other layer
- [ ] Use dependency injection to break direct dependencies

---

### 2. Clean Architecture (Recommended for Complex Features)

**Description**: Architecture that puts business logic at the center

**Layers**:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│      Frameworks &        │
│       Drivers (UI,       │
│        Database, etc.)   │
├─────────────────────────┤
│      Interface Adapters   │
│   (Controllers, Gateways)│
├─────────────────────────┤
│     Application Business │
│         Rules (Use       │
│         Cases, etc.)     │
├─────────────────────────┤
│       Enterprise Business│
│         Rules (Entities) │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Rules**:
- [ ] Inner layers cannot depend on outer layers
- [ ] Dependencies point inward
- [ ] Business rules are independent of frameworks
- [ ] Use dependency injection

---

### 3. Repository Pattern

**Description**: Abstract data access behind repositories

**Implementation**:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│       Repository         │
│   (Interface/Protocol)   │
├─────────────────────────┤
│      Data Source         │
│   (Local/Remote/DB)      │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Rules**:
- [ ] Repository defines interface for data operations
- [ ] Data Source implements repository interface
- [ ] Business Logic depends on repository interface
- [ ] Data Source can be swapped without affecting business logic

---

### 4. MVVM Pattern (Recommended for SwiftUI)

**Description**: Model-View-ViewModel pattern for UI

**Components**:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│          View            │
│   (SwiftUI/UIKit/Web)    │
├─────────────────────────┤
│       ViewModel          │
│   (Business Logic,       │
│    State Management)     │
├─────────────────────────┤
│         Model            │
│   (Data, Business Rules) │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Rules**:
- [ ] View observes ViewModel
- [ ] ViewModel exposes data and commands
- [ ] ViewModel depends on Model/Business Logic
- [ ] View does not contain business logic
- [ ] ViewModel does not know about View
