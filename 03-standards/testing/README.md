## Overview

This document defines the **testing standards** for all features developed using the Solo Agent Development Framework. These standards ensure that all code is **thoroughly tested, reliable, and maintainable**, and that all tests comply with the Constitution Principles.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Constitution Compliance**: All tests must comply with Constitution Principles
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All code must be covered by tests
3. **Maintainability**: Tests must be easy to maintain
4. **Reliability**: Tests must be reliable and deterministic
5. **Performance**: Tests must run quickly
6. **Readability**: Tests must be easy to read and understand

## Constitution Principle II: Business Logic Must Be Tested

**Requirement**: All business logic must have comprehensive unit tests

**Implications**:
- [ ] All business logic classes must have unit tests
- [ ] All business logic methods must have unit tests
- [ ] All edge cases must be covered
- [ ] All business logic must have 100% test coverage
- [ ] Tests must verify correctness, not just execution

**Business Logic Test Checklist**:
- [ ] All business logic classes have corresponding test classes
- [ ] All public methods have at least one test
- [ ] All edge cases are covered
- [ ] All error cases are covered
- [ ] Tests verify correctness, not just execution
- [ ] Tests cover all branches and paths

## Test Pyramid

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   E2E Tests  │  5-10%
                    │   (UI Tests) │
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼──────┐
                    │ Integration  │  10-20%
                    │   Tests      │
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼──────┐
                    │  Unit Tests │  70-80%
                    └─────────────┘
```

**Guidelines**:
- 70-80% of tests should be unit tests
- 10-20% of tests should be integration tests
- 5-10% of tests should be E2E/UI tests
- Focus on unit tests for business logic
- Use integration tests for component interactions
- Use E2E tests for critical user journeys

- `testWhen{Condition}_Then{ExpectedResult}`

**Examples**:
- `testGetProjectData_ValidLocation_ReturnsProjectData`

## Test Writing Standards

### Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern

**Structure**:
```swift
func test{Description}() {
    // Arrange (Setup)
    let dependency = MockDependency()
    let sut = ClassUnderTest(dependency: dependency)
    
    // Act (Execute)
    let result = sut.methodUnderTest(input: testInput)
    
    // Assert (Verify)
    XCTAssertEqual(result, expectedResult)
    XCTAssertTrue(dependency.methodCalled)
}
```

**Standards**:
- [ ] Clearly separate Arrange, Act, Assert
- [ ] Use descriptive variable names
- [ ] Keep Arrange section minimal
- [ ] Keep Act section to one line
- [ ] Keep Assert section clear and specific

### Given-When-Then Pattern

**Structure**:
```swift
func test{Description}() {
    // Given (Setup)
    givenDependencyReturnsValue(value)
    
    // When (Execute)
    let result = whenMethodIsCalled()
    
    // Then (Verify)
    thenResultShouldBe(expectedResult)
    thenDependencyShouldBeCalled()
}
```

**Standards**:
- [ ] Use helper methods for Given, When, Then
- [ ] Keep test methods readable
- [ ] Use descriptive helper method names

## Mocking and Test Doubles

### Test Double Types

| Fake | Simplified implementation | Working implementation with shortcuts |

### Mocking Standards

**When to Mock**:
- [ ] External services (APIs, databases)
- [ ] System dependencies (file system, network)
- [ ] Complex dependencies
- [ ] Dependencies with side effects

**When NOT to Mock**:
- [ ] Simple value types
