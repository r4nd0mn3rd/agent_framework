# Pocket Dev Framework Manager Skill

Load and follow the Solo Agent Development Framework (Pocket Dev). Read
constitution, methodology, templates, and standards. Use `pocket-dev` CLI for
status, validation, and the agile board.

State and artifacts live in this repository:
- Project state: `.pocket-dev/state.json`
- Task sessions: `.pocket-dev/sessions/`
- Task data: `.pocket-dev/tasks/`
- Feature specs: `specs/[feature-id]/`
- Framework docs: `.pocket-dev/00-constitution/`, `.pocket-dev/02-methodology/`, `.pocket-dev/04-templates/`, `.pocket-dev/05-checklists/`, `.pocket-dev/06-automation/agents/`

Behaviour:
1. If invoked with no arguments, show the framework status board first.
2. Support: show status/board; create new idea; select/resume/browse task; next step; mark complete; back to overview.
3. Always guide the user on the current step, assume the correct agent role by phase, and save state after changes.
4. Keep the UI simple: render a compact board and offer numbered actions.

Examples use the Pocket Dev suite and theoretical features only.
