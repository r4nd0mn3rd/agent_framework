# Solo Agent Development Framework Manager Skill

## Overview

This skill enables you to **manage your project development** using the **Solo Agent Development Framework**. It provides:

- **Project Status Overview**: See all your features/tasks and their current status
- **Task Board Navigation**: Browse and select tasks like a Jira/Kanban board
- **Task Resumption**: Continue working on a task exactly where you left off
- **Framework Guidance**: The agent follows its role and guides you through the 6-phase process
- **Status Updates**: Get real-time updates on task progress and next steps

## Quick Start

To use this skill, simply ask:

- **"Show me the framework status"** - Display project overview
- **"Select task [name/ID]"** - Navigate to a specific task
- **"Resume task [name/ID]"** - Continue working on a saved task
- **"Next step"** - Move to the next phase/gate in the framework
- **"Back to overview"** - Return to the project board

---

## Framework Integration

This skill **integrates with** and **enforces** the Home Dash Solo Agent Development Framework:

- **6 Phases**: Ideation → Discovery → Specification → Design → Implementation → Verification
- **6 Gates**: Each phase must pass its gate to proceed
- **Agent Roles**: Each agent has specific responsibilities
- **Templates & Checklists**: All artifacts follow framework standards

---

## Data Storage

The skill stores project state in:
- **Project directory**: `.framework/state.json`
- **Task directory**: `.framework/tasks/`
- **Session directory**: `.framework/sessions/`

## Skill Behavior

### When Invoked (Overview Mode)

When you invoke the skill with an overview command:

1. **Load project state** from `.framework/state.json`
2. **Scan for features** in `specs/` directory
3. **Parse feature status** from:
   - Feature directories
   - Spec documents (`spec.md`)
   - Design documents (`design.md`)
   - Task lists (`tasks.md`)
   - Gate status from checklists
4. **Display project board** with columns:
   - **Backlog** (Ideation/Phase 0)
   - **Discovery** (Phase 1)
   - **Specification** (Phase 2)
   - **Design** (Phase 3)
   - **Implementation** (Phase 4)

## Phase-Specific Guidance

### Phase 0: Ideation

**Agent Role**: Specification Agent

**Typical Commands**:
- "Help me refine my idea"
- "Create an idea document"
- "Assess feasibility"
- "Identify risks"

**Agent Response**:
```
[Specification Agent] Let's refine your idea using the framework.

Current Idea: "Add a weather widget"

To create a complete Idea Document, we need:

1. ✅ Elevator Pitch: "Add a weather widget to display current weather"
2. ❌ Problem Statement: What problem does this solve?
3. ❌ Proposed Solution: How will it work?
4. ❌ Goals: What are the primary and secondary goals?
5. ❌ Scope: What's in and out of scope?

Let's start with the Problem Statement.

Why do users need a weather widget in Home Dash?
(Type your answer, or say "skip" to move to next section)
```

### Phase 1: Discovery

**Agent Role**: Specification Agent

**Typical Commands**:
- "Research weather APIs"
- "Identify constraints"
- "Assess risks"
- "Find alternatives"

**Agent Response**:
```
[Specification Agent] Let's conduct Discovery for your weather widget.

Research Areas:
1. ✅ Domain Research: Weather data and APIs
2. ⏳ Technology Research: macOS weather APIs
3. ❌ Constraint Research: Platform limitations
4. ❌ Risk Assessment: API reliability risks

Current Focus: Technology Research

I found the following weather API options:

1. Open-Meteo
   - Pros: Free, no API key, good accuracy
   - Cons: Limited historical data
   
2. WeatherKit (Apple)
   - Pros: High accuracy, native integration
   - Cons: Paid, requires Apple Developer Program
   
3. OpenWeatherMap
   - Pros: Feature-rich, global coverage
   - Cons: Requires API key, rate limits

Which would you like to use as the default?
[1] Open-Meteo | [2] WeatherKit | [3] OpenWeatherMap | [Ask for options]
```

### Phase 2: Specification

**Agent Role**: Specification Agent

**Typical Commands**:
- "Create user stories"
- "Define requirements"
- "Identify edge cases"
- "Set success criteria"

**Agent Response**:
```
[Specification Agent] Let's create the specification for your weather widget.

We need to define User Stories first.

User Story 1 (P1): View current weather
- As a: Home Dash user
- I want to: See today's weather when I open the app
- So that: I can plan my day without checking my phone

Acceptance Scenarios:
1. ✅ Given app launched with network, When user opens app, Then current weather is displayed
2. ❌ Given app launched offline, When user opens app, Then last cached weather is shown with stale badge
3. ❌ Given weather API fails, When user opens app, Then error message is displayed

Let's complete Acceptance Scenario 2.

When the app is launched offline, what should happen?
(Type the Then condition, e.g., "Then show last cached weather with stale indicator")
```

### Phase 3: Design

**Agent Role**: Design Agent

**Typical Commands**:
- "Design the architecture"
- "Define modules"
- "Create data model"
- "Select technologies"

**Agent Response**:
```
[Design Agent] Let's design the architecture for your weather widget.

Following Constitution Principle II (Simplicity Over Abstraction),
we should use the simplest design that meets requirements.

Recommended Architecture:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   UI                    │
│  ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐  │
│  │ WeatherView │ ↔    │ViewModel    │  │
│  └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘  │
│                       ▲               │
│                       │               │
│  ┌─────────────┐      │               │
│  │WeatherService│───────┘               │
│  └─────────────┘                        │
│                       ▲               │
│                       │               │
│  ┌─────────────┐      │               │
│  │ APIClient   │───────┘               │
│  └─────────────┘                        │
│                                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Modules:
1. WeatherUI - SwiftUI views
2. WeatherService - Business logic
3. APIClient - Network layer
4. WeatherModels - Data models

Does this architecture meet your needs?
[Yes] / [No, suggest alternative] / [Modify]
```

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Agent Role**: Implementation Agent

**Typical Commands**:
- "Implement the service"
- "Write unit tests"
- "Review my code"
- "Fix this issue"

**Agent Response**:
```
[Implementation Agent] Let's implement the WeatherService.

Following Swift Coding Standard (03-standards/swift/coding-standard.md):

File: Sources/HomeDashWeather/WeatherService.swift

```swift
/// Service responsible for fetching weather data.
/// - Note: This service uses Open-Meteo as the default provider.
/// - SeeAlso: WeatherData, WeatherError
public final class WeatherService {
    // Implementation...
}
```

I'll help you implement this. Let's start with the properties.

What properties should WeatherService have?
- [ ] apiClient: APIClient (for network requests)
- [ ] cache: WeatherCache (for caching responses)
- [ ] location: CLLocation (current location)
- [Custom]

Select properties (comma-separated numbers or "all"):
```

### Phase 5: Verification

**Agent Role**: Verification Agent

**Typical Commands**:
- "Run tests"
- "Verify acceptance criteria"
- "Check documentation"
- "Validate gate requirements"

**Agent Response**:
```
[Verification Agent] Let's verify the weather widget feature.

Gate 4 Checklist (Implementation Complete):
✅ Implementation plan exists
✅ Task list exists
✅ Source code is complete
✅ Unit tests written (85% coverage)
❌ Integration tests missing
✅ Code review passed

Missing: Integration tests for WeatherService + APIClient

Let's create integration tests.

Test 1: fetchWeather with valid location
- Given: Valid CLLocation
- When: fetchWeather is called
- Then: Returns WeatherData with valid values

Would you like me to:
1. Generate the test code
2. Show you how to write it
3. Skip for now (not recommended)

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
- ❌ "Work on the feature" → Too vague
- ✅ "Select task FEA-20261029-001" → Clear and specific

### 2. Use Feature IDs
- Features have IDs like `FEA-YYYYMMDD-XXX`
- Use these IDs for precise navigation

### 3. Let the Agent Guide You
- The agent knows the framework
- Follow its suggestions for best practices
- Ask for help when stuck

### 4. Complete One Thing at a Time
- Focus on completing the current task
- The framework ensures quality at each step
- Don't skip gates or phases

### 5. Use Resume Functionality
- If you need to stop, just say "back to overview"
- Your progress is saved automatically
- You can resume later exactly where you left off

## Customization

You can customize this skill by:

1. **Adding custom commands**: Edit the `triggers` section in the frontmatter
2. **Modifying behavior**: Edit the skill instructions
3. **Adding project-specific rules**: Add to the framework documentation

---

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Triggering
- Check that your command matches a trigger pattern
- Try rephrasing your command
- Say "help" to see available commands

### State Not Saved
- Ensure `.framework/` directory exists and is writable
- Check file permissions
- Verify JSON format of state files

### Wrong Phase/Gate
- Check feature directory for actual phase
- Verify gate status in checklists
- Manually update state file if needed

## Cross-Dependency Checks

Whenever a task is **newly created** or **moved to Implementation (Phase 4)**:

1. Read `01-governance/cross-dependencies.md` and run `05-checklists/cross-dependency-checklist.md`.
2. Document related features, shared modules, external services, platform constraints, and data-model impact in `spec.md` (Background → Related Features / Dependencies).
3. Order implementation tasks by dependency; plan mocks/stubs for unfinished prerequisites.
4. Block progression to the next gate if a mandatory cross-dependency is undocumented.

## UI Mockups for Decision Making

For any UI-facing feature during Ideation/Specification:

1. Offer to create a **quick mockup** in TypeScript (React/Vue/Svelte) or HTML/CSS.
2. Store mockups under `specs/[FEATURE]/mockups/`.
3. Use mockups to compare options with the user and reveal missing specification details.
4. Record the decision and findings in the spec's "UI Mockups (if applicable)" section.
5. Mockups are throwaway; they are not production code.

## UI Mockup Toolkit

To create a low-token UI mockup scaffold, run:

```bash
06-automation/scripts/new-ui-mockup.sh <feature-id> <mockup-name> [title]
```

Then edit only the `<!-- MOCKUP BODY START/END -->` block in the generated
`specs/[FEATURE]/mockups/<name>/index.html`.
